This is a more or less quick hack that analyzes [[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] files and
gives feedback on how you are doing today (or at a given day).

The script lists:
- closed items,
- created items and
- items still due

The metrics are clearly subjective and should be improved. Please do
fork and send improvements via merge requests!
